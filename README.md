This coin world application displays the price, 24h, volume and market cap information for the first 100 ranked coins in the crypto market. When a coin is clicked in the main menu the current rank and value of the coin are displayed as well as how much the value of the coin has fluctuated in between a 1 hour to 1 year period. The 24 hour low, 24 hour high, market cap and circulating supply information are also displayed as well as the entire history of the selected coin.

I used React.js, HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create this application because I love integrating these technologies to create amazing applications as I feel that these are powerful tools to aid you in making your application perform specific functions as well as making your application user friendly. I used Axios to fetch data from the CoinGecko API as it is an amazing technology when used to filter data from an API.
